        Dropping a quick update on how my summer's been so far!

        <br><br>

        My SWE internship has been going great - I've gained a lot of invaluable experience working with a team of 15+
        people on one of State Farm's important applications, the Auto Quote Purchase tool (auto insurance accounted
        for over 60% of core property-casualty business in 2024).  This has been an amazing opportunity to get to see
        the insides of professional software engineering.

        <br><br>

        I've also started work on the side on a personal research project: potential benefits of integrating
        mobile phone devices into training systems, and improving training speed over the internet (instead of
        requiring a collection of machines wired together).  I've been really interested in DL for a while
        and decided to get started on something ambitious (already learned a ton reading professional researchers'
        papers and resources).

        <br><br>

        AP testing results came in: I got 5's on Calculus BC, Chemistry, and Language and Composition, and a 4 on
        U.S. History.  As it's going to be my junior year next year, I've also registered for a dual-credit course
        @ Collin (Plano campus), Discrete Mathematics, for my math class next year.

        <br><br>

        Things have been going well - hopefully I can grind out the rest of the summer :D
