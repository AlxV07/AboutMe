        Liam O'Connors (my partner this year) and I have gotten off to a strong start this year's team policy debate season.
        At the first online tournament, we made it to elimination rounds, placing 21st out of ~80 teams.
        I also placed as the second overall team policy speaker.

        <br><br>

        The debate resolution for this year focuses on U.S. foreign policy towards Central America, targeting
        important issues like migration, smuggling, and corruption.

        <br><br>

        This'll be a fun second year in NCFCA for me, and I'm looking forward to competing more!
