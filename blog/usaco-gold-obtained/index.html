    <h4>03/02/2025</h4>

    <div>
        Last year I promoted to Silver in my first USACO contest as a high school freshman; this February, I promoted to Gold.

        <br><br>

        I scored 733/1000 in the Feb. 2025 USACO contest, placing 578 out of the 2451 pre-college competitors
        world-wide competing in the silver division.  I solved problems 1 and 2 completely and wrote a partial solution
        for problem 3, pulling together enough points to advance.

        <br><br>

        This contest was quite a ride.
        In preparation for competing in the Silver division, I started learning C++.
        Previously, I had only used Python in CP, but as speed became more critical in higher divisions, Python needed to be replaced.
        By the February contest I knew enough C++ to write full solutions, but I still stuck with Python to start the contest
        (since it's much quicker to write, more readable, and I was more used to writing code in it).

        <br><br>

        In-contest... I solved problem 1 with a correct Python solution, and moved on to begin working on problem 2.
        After brainstorming, pseudo-coding, and testing a solution, I implemented it in Python and submitted it to the grader.
        Just a couple test cases were missed, due to time-limit-exceeded.
        I was confused for a bit as I tried to figure out how I could optimize my solution; I had written one
        that should have had a good enough time complexity to pass the test cases.
        After struggling for a little more, I gave up and moved on to tackle problem 3, hoping to come back to it later.

        <br><br>

        Coming back after implementing my partial solution for problem 3, it finally clicked to me that perhaps
        I had the right solution, but it was just Python which was too slow.
        It was unlikely (this had only happened a few times in my practice before the official contests and the problems were
        written to try to guarantee proper support for all languages), but I knew I might as well give the idea a shot.
        Quickly, I translated my Python solution line-by-line into C++.
        I submitted the program.
        The same testcases solved by my Python solution turned green.
        Then finally, I saw the rest of the test-cases pass successfully too.
        These last couple test-cases gave me enough points to make the cutoff and advance.

        <br><br>

        USACO has been an extremely valuable part of my CS education, and I'm looking forward
        to continuing my studies in more advanced topics while shooting for USACO Platinum!

        Also, as a side-quest I reached 3000 in puzzle rating on chess.com :D
