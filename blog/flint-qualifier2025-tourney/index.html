        Last week was amazing in Flint, TX, for our first region qualifier in NCFCA this year.

        <br><br>

        My partner and I advanced to semifinals, and placed 4th out of the 24 competing team policy teams.
        I placed 7th overall Team Policy speaker.
        I also placed 11th overall in the Persuasive speech category, and 16th in the Apologetics category;
        it was my first time competing in both categories.

        <br><br>

        This tourney was a great experience, and we're excited to see how the year continues!
