        I'm excited to announce I've accepted an internship offer as an
        Enterprise Technology Software Engineer @ State Farm for the summer of 2025!

        <br><br>

        A huge thanks to the people who've helped me along the way: to Dr. Veerasamy and
        Professor Gupta @ UTDallas for recommendations and guidance in my CS education,
        and especially to my parents for the encouragement and advice.

        <br><br>

        This is the first summer internship I've taken, and I'm thrilled for this opportunity
        to start my journey in the industry!
