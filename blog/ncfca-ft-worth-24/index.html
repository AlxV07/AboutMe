        This past week I've been in Ft. Worth competing in the NCFCA National Mixer hosted there this year.
        It was a great experience; my partner and I competed against some of the best teams in our region
        whilst also getting to debate teams from other regions as well.  We advanced to elimination rounds
        again but were eliminated in Double-Octofinals.

        <br><br>

        Even still, it was a great tournament overall - I've developed a lot and have learned a ton since my
        last tournament.  Both my partner and I were awarded 30 speaker points in separate rounds (the maximum
        number of points available) for the first time!  It was such a great experience to debate against
        everyone at Ft. Worth - we really enjoyed it, and we're looking forward to the tournaments in the future!
