        Just an update post for my upcoming summer plans!  With AP testing done and school finishing up, I'll be moving into
        a pretty busy break.

        <br><br>

        I'll be attending the Applied Logic programming intensive in-person at the University of Texas at Dallas next month,
        and following that I'll also be partaking in InspiritAI online.  I've started back up with my Coursera ed
        and have also started training for the upcoming USACO season.

        <br><br>

        This year's debate season is over, but the resolutions for next year are already out; we'll be preparing for it
        over the summer too.  I'm also going to be taking Latin 1B over the summer in preparation for Latin 2 next school year.
        I also recently broke 1600 rapid rating on chess.com.  We'll be heading to Edmonton in July for the Brick Invitational Hockey Tournament,
        where my sister will be playing for the Western Selects.

        <br><br>

        That's a little bit of what's going on with me for now; I'll probably update this page again later when something interesting happens ;)
